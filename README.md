Neo Mario Galaxy is an unofficial modification of Super Mario Galaxy 2.

If you want to contact me:

Requirements:

*A Computer with Windows

*USB Loader GX (to play the game image and load Ocarina cheat codes)

	https://sourceforge.net/projects/usbloadergx/

or Dolphin

	https://dolphin-emu.org/download/

*Neo Mario Galaxy (the mod itself)

	http://neomariogalaxy.bplaced.net

*ISO or WBFS image backup of your SMG2 disc.

Steps

1) On your computer:

	1.1) Locate the ISO or WBFS game image in the patch folder.

	1.2) Download the mod from its website.

	1.3) Copy the just-downloaded nmg.rar file to the patch folder.

	1.4) Extract the RAR file using WinRAR or 7zip.

	1.5) Select Manual or Automatic mode.

	1.6) Follow the instructions in the patcher.

*Note* In Manual mode, you can modify certain parts of the image your making, like Game ID, Internal Game Name, and TMD (useful for custom save game).

2) After the patcher is done, you will get an ISO file and a TXT file:

	2.1) Place the output ISO into Wii Backup Manager and transfer it to your drive.
	
	2.2) Place the output TXT file into SD:/txtcodes/
	
3.a) On your Wii:

	3.1) Now run USB Loader GX.
	3.2) Press on the game, go to (Game) Settings, go to  Game Load, and turn on Ocarina. Now go back, select Ocarina, select all of the codes on the menu, and press Create.
	3.3) Go back and press Play.

**There is a step-to-step guide with pictures in the download of the patcher.**


3.b) Search up a guide on adding Gecko Codes on Dolphin from a TXT file.

Currently only PAL has been tested, if you have issues with NTSC-U or NTSC-J, contact me with the email above or make an issue.

This can be used for other mods and games but you will need to migrate the Riivolution XML file based on Ocarina codes.
If you want to know how, contact me with the email above.
